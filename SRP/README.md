# [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle)

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the principles from SOLID, a set of object-oriented design principles. SRP states that a class or module should have a single responsibility or reason to change. In other words, a class or module should have only one primary purpose or job, and it should not be responsible for multiple unrelated tasks. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and extensibility in software systems.
