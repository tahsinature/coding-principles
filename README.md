# Coding Principles

This repository is a reference for myself, and you may also use it as reference during your next design, discussion, or review. Here I will mention about some widely used and known principles in programming. But, if you really want to fill your head with principles for software engineering, take a look at this huge list: [List of software development philosophies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_development_philosophies).

### Generic

- [SRP](./SRP%20-%20Single-Responsibility%20Principle/)
- [OCP](./OCP%20-%20Open-Closed%20Principle/)
- [LSP](./LSP%20-%20Liskov%20Substitution%20Principle/)
- [ISP](./ISP%20-%20Interface%20Segregation%20Principle/)
- [DIP](./DIP%20-%20Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle/)
- [DRY](./DRY%20-%20Don't%20Repeat%20Yourself/)
- [KISS](./KISS%20-%20Keep%20It%20Simple,%20Stupid/)
- [YAGNI](./YAGNI%20-%20You%20Ain't%20Gonna%20Need%20It/)

In addition to these principles, it's also important to follow the SOLID principles, which encompass many of the above principles and provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for writing maintainable and extensible software.
