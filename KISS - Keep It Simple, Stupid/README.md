# [Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)

The Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle is a software development principle that advocates for simplicity in design and implementation.

<br />

Here's an example in Python that illustrates the KISS principle:

In [bad.py](/KISS/bad.py) example, we have a function calculate_fibonacci() that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. However, the implementation is overly complex with multiple if-elif conditions and recursive calls. This violates the KISS principle, as the code is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to understand.

> A better approach would be to adhere to the KISS principle by simplifying the code.

In [good.py](/KISS/good.py) example, we have simplified the code by using a loop and two variables to calculate the Fibonacci number iteratively. This makes the code more straightforward and easier to understand, adhering to the KISS principle.
